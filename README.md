# Nodes of You 🌑🚀

**Nodes of You** is a decentralized storytelling network and verifiable user research ecosystem documented in the [Nodes of You Lite Paper](LITE_PAPER.md).

## Project Overview

We are building a bridge between anonymous anecdotes and verifiable data.
*   **Storytelling**: Documenting the "Kasinomics revolution" in Africa.
*   **Privacy**: Using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to verify "Real & African" status without revealing identity.
*   **Incentives**: A sustainable economy where users monetize their data and stories.

## 📄 Lite Paper

Read the full [Lite Paper](LITE_PAPER.md) for a deep dive into the business model, methodology, and roadmap.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (Lightweight, fast, no framework overhead).
*   **Styling**: "Wen Moon" Aesthetic (African Dark Mode + Glassmorphism).
*   **Logic**: `app.js` handles form logic, simulated ZK proofs, and multiligual support.
*   **Internationalization**: `i18n.js` supports 10+ African languages.
